# Lexmount Browser CLI (Rust)

Native Rust SDK and command-line client for Lexmount cloud browsers. The binary is
named `browser-cli` so existing agent instructions can migrate without changing
their command prefix.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/browser-cli version
```

Configuration is loaded from `LEXMOUNT_API_KEY`, `LEXMOUNT_PROJECT_ID`, optional
`LEXMOUNT_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.lexmount.cn`), and optional
`LEXMOUNT_REGION`. `browser-cli auth login` uses a loopback callback and PKCE;
pass `--client-name "<name>"` to identify the calling Agent in the approval page,
or omit it to use `Agent`. Credentials are stored at
`~/.config/lexmount/browser-cli/credentials.json` with mode `0600` on Unix and
are never printed.

All commands emit one JSON document. Run `browser-cli --help` for the complete
surface.

## Agent Skill package

The publishable Skill is in `skills/lexmount-browser`. Build a deterministic ZIP:

```bash
./scripts/package-skill.sh
```

The ZIP contains `SKILL.md`, references, and platform bootstrap scripts at its
archive root. Native executables are published separately and are not placed in
the Skill ZIP. On first use, the matching bootstrap script downloads the pinned
release from Tencent Cloud COS and verifies its SHA-256 digest. Set
`LEXMOUNT_BROWSER_CLI_VERSION` or `LEXMOUNT_BROWSER_CLI_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` only
when testing a different published release or mirror.

Agents resolve bundled scripts and binaries from the directory containing the
loaded `SKILL.md`: Codex uses the absolute source path supplied in the Skill
metadata, Claude Code uses `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, and WorkBuddy/CodeBuddy uses
`${CODEBUDDY_SKILL_DIR}`. These are host-level Skill locators, not installation
or download inputs. Once started, the bootstrap and doctor scripts also locate
the Skill directory from their own path.

Published binaries are intentionally limited to two targets: macOS arm64 and
Windows x64. The macOS binary is signed with a Developer ID Application
certificate, hardened-runtime enabled, and accepted by Apple's notarization
service before it is published. Linux and macOS Intel remain unsupported
release platforms.

The release workflow reads the signing certificate and notarization credentials
from the `macos-release` GitHub environment. It requires
`MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_P12_BASE64`,
`MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_P12_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_NOTARY_APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_NOTARY_TEAM_ID`, and `APPLE_NOTARY_APP_PASSWORD`.

The publish job uploads both platform binaries and their checksum manifest to
Tencent Cloud COS through the `cos-release` GitHub environment. It requires
`TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_KEY` secrets plus
`COS_BUCKET`, `COS_REGION`, `COS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and `COS_OBJECT_PREFIX`
variables.
