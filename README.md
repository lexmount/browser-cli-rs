# Lexmount Browser CLI (Rust)

Native Rust SDK and command-line client for Lexmount cloud browsers. The binary is
named `browser-cli` so existing agent instructions can migrate without changing
their command prefix.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/browser-cli version
```

Configuration is loaded from `LEXMOUNT_API_KEY`, `LEXMOUNT_PROJECT_ID`, optional
`LEXMOUNT_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.lexmount.cn`), and optional
`LEXMOUNT_REGION`. `browser-cli auth login` uses a loopback callback and PKCE;
pass `--client-name "<name>"` to identify the calling Agent in the approval page,
or omit it to use `Agent`. Credentials are stored at
`~/.config/lexmount/browser-cli/credentials.json` with mode `0600` on Unix and
are never printed.

Commands emit one JSON document; `tunnel open` emits its ready result before staying alive. Run `browser-cli --help` for the complete
surface.

### Errors and output pipes

Successful commands write `{"ok":true,"data":...}` to stdout. Runtime failures
write `{"ok":false,"error":"...","message":"..."}` to stderr and exit with
status 1. JavaScript evaluation failures keep the `cdp_error` category, but now
include the browser's error summary and, when provided, one-based line/column
positions. For example, a missing selector reports `Error: selector not found`
instead of only `Uncaught`. This also applies to DOM lookup/checks in `click`
and evaluation in `fill`; it does not retry or fix the action.

The summary is the first line of the exception description (up to 1024 Unicode
characters plus a truncation marker), falling back to a primitive thrown value
or CDP's error text when needed. The CLI does not append the stack trace,
source URL, evaluated expression or remote object preview. Exception messages
are page-provided text and may themselves contain sensitive data; inspect them
before sharing logs.

If a stdout consumer closes its pipe early (for example, `... | head`), an
otherwise successful command exits normally without a BrokenPipe panic.
Other output write/flush errors still exit with status 1. An operation that
failed still exits with status 1 even if stderr is closed and cannot report the
error. These source changes require a new binary; updating Skill instructions
does not change an already installed CLI.

## Real mouse movement

`action move` dispatches actual unpressed CDP mouse samples to one explicit Target.
Supply a real previous input position; the CLI never invents a starting position:

```bash
browser-cli action --target-id TARGET_ID click --session-id SESSION_ID --selector '#name' --report-point
# Copy the complete returned data object, not guessed coordinates:
browser-cli action --target-id TARGET_ID move --session-id SESSION_ID --selector '#notes' --from-json '{"x":100,"y":80,"target_id":"TARGET_ID","coordinate_space":"css_viewport","viewport_width":1280,"viewport_height":720,"device_scale":1,"page_scale":1,"page_generation":"GENERATION"}' --duration-ms 600
```

The numeric coordinates above are examples. Ordinary `click` still returns
`data:true`; `--report-point` opts into an object with the actual x/y, CSS viewport
metadata, document generation and Target ID. A move returns the same endpoint
fields plus `steps`, `elapsed_ms` and `requested_duration_ms`; subsequent moves can
use that real endpoint. Coordinates are CSS viewport pixels. `--from-json` must match the current Target, coordinate space, document and full
viewport metadata; a stale origin is rejected before input. External input,
resizing or navigation can invalidate a known position; obtain a new real point.

Duration defaults to 600 ms, bounded to 100...2000 ms. Timing follows a monotonic
clock with eased geometry and at most about 60 samples per second. Each sample
waits for CDP, so cloud latency can reduce the actual sample count and extend the
elapsed time. Desktop move events describe only samples acknowledged by CDP,
not interpolated or predicted positions. They remain best effort.

The original DOM object and endpoint stay locked. A detached, covered, disabled,
moved target or changed document/viewport stops the move; it does not chase a new
selector, press a button, retry input or switch Tabs. Hover can trigger page
handlers. This is not a promise that moving over an arbitrary page has no effects.

## Session list pagination

`session list` reads one page. Optional positive page flags map to the existing
v2 API's `page` and `pageSize` fields; page numbers start at 1:

```bash
browser-cli session list --status active --page 1 --page-size 100
browser-cli session list --status active --page 2 --page-size 100
```

The result keeps the existing `data.sessions` and `data.pagination` structure.
Use `currentPage` and `totalPages` to request further pages. Omitting either
flag preserves that server default; an old command without page flags sends
the same request as before. The CLI does not automatically combine pages.

Rust SDK callers retain `Client::list_sessions(status)` and can opt into
`Client::list_sessions_with_pagination(status, page, page_size)`, where the two
page arguments are `Option<u64>` and supplied values must be greater than zero.

## Local network proxy tunnels

Introduced in 1.3.0. This requires a newly built or published binary; updating the
Skill alone does not add the commands. `tunnel open` runs on the machine whose
network/VPN the cloud browser should use:

```bash
# Terminal 1: keep running on the local network machine.
browser-cli tunnel open
# Prints once, only after the gateway is ready:
# {"ok":true,"data":{"tunnel_id":"lt1.…","region_id":"nanjing-1","ready":true}}

# Terminal 2: use the same account/project and API environment.
browser-cli session create --local-proxy-tunnel-id TUNNEL_ID
browser-cli action open-url --session-id SESSION_ID --url https://oa.internal/
browser-cli tunnel status --tunnel-id TUNNEL_ID
browser-cli session close --session-id SESSION_ID
# Ctrl+C in terminal 1, or:
browser-cli tunnel close --tunnel-id TUNNEL_ID
```

The tunnel command stays in the foreground after flushing its JSON result.
Keep that process alive while sessions need the tunnel. `--duration SECONDS`
can bound its lifetime (default 0 means until Ctrl+C, termination, or server
revocation). Ctrl+C/SIGTERM stops forwarding and revokes the tunnel; closing it
from another process also stops forwarding. Abrupt process loss is handled by
the gateway heartbeat/lease expiration. Closing a tunnel does not close browser
sessions or stop their runtime billing; close those sessions separately. The
tunnel also does not send browser-session keepalives.

Session creation pins the region encoded in the tunnel ID. A conflicting
`LEXMOUNT_REGION`, `--official-proxy`, or a non-`normal` browser mode is rejected.
The project needs the server's `custom_proxy` capability. A closed/offline or
foreign-project tunnel is rejected by the server. No direct/cloud-network
fallback is attempted. Existing action/CDP commands do not need additional flags.

Destination DNS uses the local OS resolver, including hosts/VPN configuration,
and TCP connects from this machine. HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket and secure WebSocket
bytes pass through unchanged. It does not import local browser cookies, trust
stores or integrated login, and is not a general VPN/UDP tunnel. The selected
browser sessions can reach destinations accessible from the tunnel machine;
keep the connector running only for the sessions you intend to grant access.

The reverse WSS uses short, single-use tickets and `lexmount.local-proxy.v1`;
API keys and tickets are never printed or placed in its URL. It requires WSS
except for loopback test fixtures, validates TLS, and rejects redirects. The
connector's WSS honors the same HTTP CONNECT environment proxy settings as CDP;
local destination TCP is direct through the OS network. Reconnect requests a new
ticket and waits for ready again. Existing TCP streams are closed and are never
replayed. The initial JSON is a startup readiness snapshot; query `tunnel status`
for server state after a later disconnect.

The transport limits each connection to 128 streams, each direction to a 256 KiB
credit window, and data frames to 64 KiB. Credits are returned only after writing
bytes to local TCP. Half-close preserves the reverse direction. DNS/TCP connects
have a 15-second deadline; DNS uses the bounded OS resolver described below.
Ready waits and WebSocket connection attempts also have bounded deadlines.

Rust callers use `Client::open_tunnel()`, retain the returned `LocalTunnel`, and
set `CreateSession.proxy` to `{"type":"local","tunnel_id":tunnel.id()}`. The handle
exposes `ready()`, `id()`, `region_id()`, and `close()`. Drop performs best-effort
revocation; call `close()` explicitly to observe cleanup errors. An owned handle
must outlive its sessions' network use.

## Cloud runtime proxies

Version 1.2.1 routes CDP WebSocket connections through the environment's HTTP
CONNECT proxy. `wss://` uses `HTTPS_PROXY` and `ws://` uses `HTTP_PROXY`, with
`ALL_PROXY` as the fallback; lowercase variables and `NO_PROXY` are handled by
the same proxy matcher used by the HTTP client. Target DNS is resolved by the
proxy. Proxy Basic authentication stays on CONNECT and is not forwarded to CDP.
TLS certificate and hostname checks remain enabled. A rejected proxy request
never falls back to a direct connection.

This transport currently accepts `http://` proxies only; HTTPS-to-proxy and
SOCKS proxies return an explicit unsupported configuration error. Direct and
proxied connections share one 15-second network connection budget, covering
DNS, TCP, CONNECT and TLS/WebSocket handshake across all redirects. CONNECT
headers are limited to 16 KiB. Each blocking network operation uses the remaining
budget; a slow peer cannot restart it by sending another byte.

OS DNS resolution preserves hosts/VPN configuration. Two process-wide workers
and four queue slots bound background work. The caller stops waiting at its
deadline; an in-flight OS lookup cannot be cancelled, and its late result cannot
open a connection. Expired queued lookups are skipped. If the pool is saturated,
new hostname lookups fail with `DNS resolver busy; retry later` until workers
recover. Numeric addresses bypass DNS.

Connection timeouts exit the CLI with status 1 and a JSON error on stderr, e.g.
`{"ok":false,"error":"timeout","message":"request timed out: CDP connection (stage: proxy_dns, budget: 15s)"}`.
Stage names distinguish `proxy_dns`/`target_dns`, `proxy_tcp`/`target_tcp`,
`proxy_connect`, and `websocket_handshake`/`tls_websocket_handshake` without exposing
URLs or credentials. A connection timeout occurs before any CDP command is sent.
The budget ends at the WebSocket upgrade: REST session requests, CDP target
attachment, and later browser actions retain their existing timeout behavior.
It is not a deadline for an entire CLI command or Agent turn, nor does it trigger
automatic action retries. These changes require a new CLI release; published
1.1.15 and 1.2.0 binaries do not acquire them by updating Skill instructions.

## Select a page in a multi-tab session

Explicit page selection is introduced in version 1.2.0. Check that the installed
binary's `browser-cli action --help` lists `--target-id`; the published 1.1.15
binary does not have it. The package version and both bootstrap scripts target
1.3.0 together. Merging or building this source does not publish release assets:
bootstrap can install 1.3.0 only after its binaries and checksums are published
to COS. Until then, use a source build for local verification.

Every `action` command accepts `--target-id`; it is required for `move` and
optional for other actions. Obtain the page's CDP
target ID from `session targets` (the page entry's `id` in a DevTools `/json`
listing), then pass it on **each** action that should use that tab:

```bash
browser-cli session targets --session-id SESSION_ID
browser-cli action snapshot --session-id SESSION_ID --target-id PAGE_ID
browser-cli action fill --session-id SESSION_ID --target-id PAGE_ID --selector '#query' --value 'search terms'
browser-cli action click --session-id SESSION_ID --target-id PAGE_ID --selector '#search'
# If this opened a new tab, list targets again and select the result page.
browser-cli session targets --session-id SESSION_ID
browser-cli action wait-selector --session-id SESSION_ID --target-id RESULT_PAGE_ID --selector '#results'
browser-cli action snapshot --session-id SESSION_ID --target-id RESULT_PAGE_ID
```

The option can also precede the action subcommand:
`browser-cli action --target-id PAGE_ID snapshot --session-id SESSION_ID`.
It applies to all actions, including `open-url`, `screenshot`, `pdf`, and `raw`;
their JSON result shapes are unchanged. It is not a session/context option.

The browser session ID and page target ID identify different things. An explicit
target must be an existing page in that browser session. A missing/closed target
returns `not_found`; a non-page target returns `configuration_error`. If the page
closes between discovery and attachment, the CDP error is propagated. None of
these cases falls back to another tab or creates a blank page.

Without `--target-id`, the existing default is unchanged: select the first page
returned by CDP, or create `about:blank` if no page exists. That default is **not**
a guarantee to follow a popup or select the most recently used tab. Explicit
selection is per invocation; there is no persisted active-page state or automatic
new-tab switching. Select by the task's expected URL/title, not list position,
and inspect again when there are multiple plausible pages.

SDK callers can use `lexmount_browser::cdp::Cdp::connect_to_target(ws_url, page_id)`.
`Cdp::connect(ws_url)` retains its existing default behavior.

### Native click input

Starting in 1.2.4, `action click --selector CSS` (and SDK `Cdp::click`) scrolls
the element into view and sends CDP `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` move/press/release
events. This replaces JavaScript `HTMLElement.click()`, which produces an
untrusted event without user activation and can leave `window.open()` blocked.
It does not add a user gesture to arbitrary `action eval` expressions.

Before pressing, the CLI checks that the selected element is attached, enabled,
visible and hit-testable at a client-rectangle center inside the viewport.
Disabled controls/ancestors, ARIA-disabled or inert ancestors, and overlays are
rejected. It rechecks the **same DOM object and point** after hover; a replacement,
movement away from that point, or new overlay causes a `cdp_error`, not a click on
another element. There is no automatic retry or JavaScript-click fallback.
These checks are not an atomic lock against later page mutations.

The existing main-document CSS selector scope is unchanged: this does not add
iframe or shadow-root traversal. `{"ok":true,"data":true}` means input was
dispatched, **not** that the website completed the task or opened a popup. Site
logic/browser policy can still prevent an outcome. Inspect the page/targets and
explicitly select any new result tab as shown above; click never navigates to an
inferred URL or automatically switches tabs. A failed command may have partially
dispatched input; inspect state before retrying it.

### Local regression tests

```bash
cargo test --all-targets --locked
# Use full Chrome/Chromium to cover popup blocking; headless-shell alone is insufficient.
BROWSER_CLI_TEST_CHROME=/path/to/chrome cargo test --locked --test page_targets_browser -- --ignored --nocapture
```

In PowerShell, set `$env:BROWSER_CLI_TEST_CHROME` to the executable path before
running the same `cargo test` command. The opt-in test launches a separate
headless profile and loopback-only fixtures; it does not use a Lexmount account,
real websites, or an existing browser profile. The default suite exercises all
action routes and failure/no-fallback behavior with deterministic CDP fixtures.
CI also runs the real-browser suite with its installed full Google Chrome.
Tests assert trusted input/user activation as well as popup creation, and cover
scrolling, hidden/disabled/covered elements, hover changes and cleanup failures.
Some headless-shell builds allow untrusted popups; passing there alone does not
demonstrate the click fix.

## Agent Skill package

The publishable Skill is in `skills/lexmount-browser`. Build a deterministic ZIP:

```bash
./scripts/package-skill.sh
```

The ZIP contains `SKILL.md`, references, and platform bootstrap scripts at its
archive root. Native executables are published separately and are not placed in
the Skill ZIP. On first use, the matching bootstrap script downloads the pinned
release from Tencent Cloud COS and verifies its SHA-256 digest. Set
`LEXMOUNT_BROWSER_CLI_VERSION` or `LEXMOUNT_BROWSER_CLI_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL` only
when testing a different published release or mirror.

Updating the Skill files does not replace an existing Skill-local executable.
After the pinned release is available, an authorized upgrade can rerun the
matching bundled bootstrap script, then verify `browser-cli version` and
`browser-cli action --help`. If the release is not available, report that
dependency rather than substituting an older binary for a task needing the new
feature. Release tags must match the Cargo and bootstrap versions; never
overwrite an existing release with changed binaries.

### Release checklist

1. In a reviewed PR, update the package version in `Cargo.toml`, the
   `lexmount-browser` entry in `Cargo.lock`, and the defaults in both
   `skills/lexmount-browser/scripts/bootstrap.ps1` and `bootstrap.sh`.
2. Run `.github/scripts/test-release-version.ps1` with Windows PowerShell 5.1
   or PowerShell 7, then `.github/scripts/verify-release-version.ps1 -ReleaseTag
   v1.3.0` (substitute the intended version). Complete CI and merge the PR.
3. Create the matching tag **on that merged commit**. Typing a new tag or
   release title in GitHub does not update any source version. The release
   workflow rejects inconsistent versions before building, signing or uploading.
4. Wait for every build and the publish job. Each platform's compiled binary
   must report the tag's version before packaging. Verify the downloaded asset's
   checksum and `browser-cli version`; the Skill ZIP must pin the same version.

The published `v1.2.2` assets include the error-reporting fixes, but were built
with Cargo version `1.2.1` and Skill bootstrap defaults `1.2.1`. They are
misversioned; use the corrected `v1.2.3` release once published. Do not retag or
overwrite `v1.2.2`: consumers may already have its original files and checksums.

Agents resolve bundled scripts and binaries from the directory containing the
loaded `SKILL.md`: Codex uses the absolute source path supplied in the Skill
metadata, Claude Code uses `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, and WorkBuddy/CodeBuddy uses
`${CODEBUDDY_SKILL_DIR}`. These are host-level Skill locators, not installation
or download inputs. Once started, the bootstrap and doctor scripts also locate
the Skill directory from their own path.

Published binaries include macOS arm64, Windows x64, and static Linux x64. The
macOS binary is signed with a Developer ID Application certificate,
hardened-runtime enabled, and accepted by Apple's notarization service before
it is published. macOS Intel remains an unsupported release platform.

The release workflow reads the signing certificate and notarization credentials
from the `macos-release` GitHub environment. It requires
`MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_P12_BASE64`,
`MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_P12_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_NOTARY_APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_NOTARY_TEAM_ID`, and `APPLE_NOTARY_APP_PASSWORD`.

The publish job uploads all three platform binaries and their checksum manifest to
Tencent Cloud COS through the `cos-release` GitHub environment. It requires
`TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_KEY` secrets plus
`COS_BUCKET`, `COS_REGION`, `COS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and `COS_OBJECT_PREFIX`
variables.
